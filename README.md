# XamlTea

## What

[The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) for building WPF and XAML applications.. in future.

Adapted from this [great Elm F# project](https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Elm).

__Currently a proof-of-concept. Please, help me to make it a real thing.__

## Progress

- [x] Make CounterList sample work
- [x] Add ToDo sample. It is the most ;-)
- [ ] Usable default UI, e.g. scrolling, no buttons taken whole window, etc.
- [ ] Extend Tea with commands and subscriptions from  @AnthonyLloyd's [Event F# project](https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Event)
- [ ] Integrate the Tea Component on a level of Control instead of Application, for easy embedding into existing apps
- [ ] Optimize Diff implementation
- [ ] Add Xamarin.Forms implementation
- [ ] Figure out style and layout, may be similar to [Elm Style.elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYb2GDWMIm0)
