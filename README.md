# Tea

## What

[The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) for building .NET UI applications: WPF and more to come..


Adapted to C# from this [Great Elm F# project](https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Elm).

## Plan

- [x] Make CounterList sample work
- [x] Add ToDo sample. It is the most ;-)
- [ ] Extend Tea with commands and subscriptions from  @AnthonyLloyd's [Event F# project](https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Event)
- [ ] Integrate the Tea component in an unabtrusive way, preferrable as UserControl
- [ ] Optimize Diff implementation
- [ ] Add Xamarin.Forms implementation
- [ ] Figure out style and layout, may be similar to [Elm Style.elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYb2GDWMIm0) 
- [ ] Better UI
